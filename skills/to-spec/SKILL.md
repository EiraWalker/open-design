## OpenDesign execution

Run the workflow below for the user's engineering or learning task. This is a utility skill; its output is the conversation or documents the workflow requests.

Use only tools available in this chat. When the workflow calls a Skill tool or names another skill, read that skill's bundled workflow from the links below and follow it in the current context. A Skill tool is optional. Resolve every relative reference against the document containing it, using the staged skill directory advertised by OpenDesign.

Each bundled workflow document also contains its companion files under headings with their original filenames. When instructions reference a companion document or template, read that section of the bundle. If a command needs a real template file, first save that section's exact contents to a project-local working file and use its path. Skill metadata and these companion contents are reference material; load only the workflow and sections needed for the current step.

Use a supported question form for interviews, or ask numbered questions in chat and wait for the user's answers. Run subagents only when the host provides them and the task permits delegation; otherwise perform the same steps sequentially. Keep task dependencies, evidence, review criteria and user decision points intact.

Filesystem changes, commands, browsing and issue-tracker operations require the corresponding available tools and access. If a required capability is missing, explain the limitation and ask for the minimum missing input; report only actions actually completed. Shell scripts require a compatible shell. Use host context controls only when available; otherwise write a handoff and let the user open a new chat. Follow the user's authorized scope for commits, pushes and external changes.

## Upstream workflow

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec. Do NOT interview the user; just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
