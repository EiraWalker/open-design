## OpenDesign execution

Run the workflow below for the user's engineering or learning task. This is a utility skill; its output is the conversation or documents the workflow requests.

Use only tools available in this chat. When the workflow calls a Skill tool or names another skill, read that skill's bundled workflow from the links below and follow it in the current context. A Skill tool is optional. Resolve every relative reference against the document containing it, using the staged skill directory advertised by OpenDesign.

Each bundled workflow document also contains its companion files under headings with their original filenames. When instructions reference a companion document or template, read that section of the bundle. If a command needs a real template file, first save that section's exact contents to a project-local working file and use its path. Skill metadata and these companion contents are reference material; load only the workflow and sections needed for the current step.

Use a supported question form for interviews, or ask numbered questions in chat and wait for the user's answers. Run subagents only when the host provides them and the task permits delegation; otherwise perform the same steps sequentially. Keep task dependencies, evidence, review criteria and user decision points intact.

Filesystem changes, commands, browsing and issue-tracker operations require the corresponding available tools and access. If a required capability is missing, explain the limitation and ask for the minimum missing input; report only actions actually completed. Shell scripts require a compatible shell. Use host context controls only when available; otherwise write a handoff and let the user open a new chat. Follow the user's authorized scope for commits, pushes and external changes.

## Upstream workflow

# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `GLOSSARY.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](references/engineer-skills/domain-modeling.md#file-glossary-format-md).

`GLOSSARY.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](references/engineer-skills/domain-modeling.md#file-adr-format-md).
