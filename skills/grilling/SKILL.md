## OpenDesign execution

Run the workflow below for the user's engineering or learning task. This is a utility skill; its output is the conversation or documents the workflow requests.

Use only tools available in this chat. When the workflow calls a Skill tool or names another skill, read that skill's bundled workflow from the links below and follow it in the current context. A Skill tool is optional. Resolve every relative reference against the document containing it, using the staged skill directory advertised by OpenDesign.

Each bundled workflow document also contains its companion files under headings with their original filenames. When instructions reference a companion document or template, read that section of the bundle. If a command needs a real template file, first save that section's exact contents to a project-local working file and use its path. Skill metadata and these companion contents are reference material; load only the workflow and sections needed for the current step.

Use a supported question form for interviews, or ask numbered questions in chat and wait for the user's answers. Run subagents only when the host provides them and the task permits delegation; otherwise perform the same steps sequentially. Keep task dependencies, evidence, review criteria and user decision points intact.

Filesystem changes, commands, browsing and issue-tracker operations require the corresponding available tools and access. If a required capability is missing, explain the limitation and ask for the minimum missing input; report only actions actually completed. Shell scripts require a compatible shell. Use host context controls only when available; otherwise write a handoff and let the user open a new chat. Follow the user's authorized scope for commits, pushes and external changes.

### Bundled workflows and companion files

## Upstream workflow

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
