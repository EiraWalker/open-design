## OpenDesign execution

Run the workflow below for the user's engineering or learning task. This is a utility skill; its output is the conversation or documents the workflow requests.

Use only tools available in this chat. When the workflow calls a Skill tool or names another skill, read that skill's bundled workflow from the links below and follow it in the current context. A Skill tool is optional. Resolve every relative reference against the document containing it, using the staged skill directory advertised by OpenDesign.

Each bundled workflow document also contains its companion files under headings with their original filenames. When instructions reference a companion document or template, read that section of the bundle. If a command needs a real template file, first save that section's exact contents to a project-local working file and use its path. Skill metadata and these companion contents are reference material; load only the workflow and sections needed for the current step.

Use a supported question form for interviews, or ask numbered questions in chat and wait for the user's answers. Run subagents only when the host provides them and the task permits delegation; otherwise perform the same steps sequentially. Keep task dependencies, evidence, review criteria and user decision points intact.

Filesystem changes, commands, browsing and issue-tracker operations require the corresponding available tools and access. If a required capability is missing, explain the limitation and ask for the minimum missing input; report only actions actually completed. Shell scripts require a compatible shell. Use host context controls only when available; otherwise write a handoff and let the user open a new chat. Follow the user's authorized scope for commits, pushes and external changes.

## Upstream workflow

# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered, using the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [LOGIC.md](references/engineer-skills/prototype.md#file-logic-md). Build a single shareable HTML file (free-play buttons plus tabbed guided walkthroughs) that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper, and that a non-developer can drive.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [UI.md](references/engineer-skills/prototype.md#file-ui-md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts, so getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** Locate the prototype code close to where it will actually be used (next to the module or page it's prototyping for) so context is obvious, but name it so a casual reader can see it's a prototype, not production. For throwaway UI routes, obey whatever routing convention the project already uses; don't invent a new top-level structure.
2. **Trivial to run.** A UI prototype starts from one command in the project's task runner: `pnpm <name>`, `python <path>`, `bun <path>`, etc. A logic demo is a single HTML file the user double-clicks. Either way, no thinking required to start it.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE, wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Capture it when done.** Fold any validated decision into the real code, then capture the prototype itself as a **primary source**: commit it to a throwaway branch, out of main, and leave a context pointer to that branch on the implementation issue. Capture the answer too (the verdict and the question it settled) in the issue or a commit. The main branch keeps only the validated decision.
